Statement 1
if(karel.canPickThing())                                    
{                                                        
    karel.turnRight();                               
} else {                                                   
    karel.turnLeft();                                
}  

Statement 2
if(!karel.canPickThing())
{                                                                          
    karel.turnLeft();
} else {                                                                                                                          
    karel.turnRight();
}   

They are the same. Lets say that karel is not standing on a thing.
The output for both statements would be karel turning left. Because the first 
statement says that if karel is standing (Which he is not) he will turn right 
but since he is not standing on something it will skip to turnleft.
While statement 2 says that if he is not standing on something he will turn left.
and since he is not the code while turn him left and skip the else command.
Therefore, Karel will turn left.
